            question:
              "Your executive sponsor visits the executives of an important customer. During the visit, they communicate to her what they believe is an important feature for your next product release, and your sponsor promises it will be in the release. Your team builds and delivers the feature as promised. Over the next three months, your measures of the usage of the feature show that it has not been used. When you ask users from this important customer “why?”, they indicate that they did not need the feature and their executives don’t really understand the needs of their users. Do you communicate this to your executive sponsor? (choose the best answer)",
